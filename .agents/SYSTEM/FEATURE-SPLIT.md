**Last Updated:** 2026-01-20

This document defines which features belong in Core OSS vs Cloud SaaS. AI agents should reference this before implementing features.

## Cloud SaaS Only Features (NOT in Core OSS)

These features require multi-tenant infrastructure and are monetization drivers:

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Team collaboration | Multi-tenant architecture, user management |
| Cloud storage/CDN | Infrastructure cost, S3/CloudFront |
| Usage billing & quotas | SaaS monetization, Stripe integration |
| Managed hosting | Operational overhead, scaling |
| Priority support | Revenue driver |
| Workflow marketplace | Platform network effects, moderation |
| Organization management | Multi-tenant data isolation |
| Role-based access control | Enterprise feature |
| SSO/SAML | Enterprise authentication |
| Audit logs | Compliance feature |
| White-labeling | Enterprise customization |

## Decision Criteria

**Goes in Core OSS if:**
- Works completely offline/self-hosted
- No external service dependencies beyond user-provided API keys
- Single-user/single-tenant usage
- Enables community contribution
- Core workflow functionality

**Goes in Cloud SaaS if:**
- Requires multi-tenant data isolation
- Has infrastructure costs (storage, CDN, compute)
- Needs centralized management/moderation
- Is a monetization feature
- Requires ongoing operational support

## AI Agent Guidelines

1. **Never implement SaaS features in Core** - Check this file first
2. **No organization/team references** - Core is single-user
3. **No billing/quota code** - Core is free/unlimited
4. **No cloud storage integration** - Use local filesystem
5. **Self-contained is key** - All features must work offline
