# Open Source Rebrand: genfeedai/genfeed

**Status:** In Progress (GitHub issue open)
**Priority:** High
**Created:** 2026-01-15
**Category:** Infrastructure / Branding

---

## Overview

### Problem Statement
The project is currently named "content-workflow" with `@content-workflow/*` package scope. To open source this project and build the Genfeed brand, we need to rebrand to `genfeedai/core` with `@genfeedai/*` package scope. This aligns with the Vercel/Next.js model where the OSS project builds brand awareness for the commercial SaaS offering.

### Goals
- Rebrand monorepo from `content-workflow` to `genfeed`
- Change package scope from `@content-workflow/*` to `@genfeedai/*`
- Prepare repository for public open source release
- Add proper licensing (AGPL-3.0)
- Create self-hosting documentation
- Remove proprietary/internal references

### Non-Goals
- Building the commercial SaaS offering (separate effort)
- Marketing or launch strategy
- npm package publishing (packages remain workspace-local)
- CI/CD pipeline setup (separate task)

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a** developer interested in workflow automation
**I want** to self-host Genfeed
**So that** I can build AI-powered content workflows without vendor lock-in

### Additional Stories
- As a contributor, I want clear guidelines on how to contribute
- As a user, I want one-command Docker setup for self-hosting
- As a developer, I want to understand the architecture quickly
- As a potential customer, I want to evaluate the product before buying the SaaS

## Technical Design

### File Changes Required

#### Root Level
```
package.json              # name: "genfeed"
README.md                 # Complete rewrite for OSS
LICENSE                   # New: AGPL-3.0
CONTRIBUTING.md           # New: Contribution guidelines
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md        # New: Community standards
docker-compose.yml        # New: Self-hosting
.env.example              # New: Environment template
```

#### Apps
```
apps/api/package.json     # name: "@genfeedai/api"
apps/api/Dockerfile       # Update if needed
apps/api/.env.example     # New: API env template
apps/web/package.json     # name: "@genfeedai/web"
apps/web/Dockerfile       # New: Web Dockerfile
apps/web/.env.example     # New: Web env template
```

#### Packages
```
packages/types/package.json    # name: "@genfeedai/types"
packages/core/package.json     # name: "@genfeedai/core", update deps
packages/storage/package.json  # name: "@genfeedai/storage", update deps
```

### Import Updates

All files importing from `@content-workflow/*` must be updated:
```typescript
// Before
import { WorkflowNode } from '@content-workflow/types';

// After
import { WorkflowNode } from '@genfeedai/types';
```

### Docker Architecture

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  web:
    build: ./apps/web
    ports: ["3000:3000"]
    depends_on: [api]

  api:
    build: ./apps/api
    ports: ["3001:3001"]
    depends_on: [mongodb, redis]

  mongodb:
    image: mongo:7
    volumes: [mongodb_data:/data/db]

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    volumes: [redis_data:/data]
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Package Renaming
1. Update root package.json name
2. Update all apps/*/package.json names
3. Update all packages/*/package.json names
4. Update workspace dependency references
5. Run `bun install` to regenerate lockfile
6. Search/replace all imports from `@content-workflow/*` to `@genfeedai/*`
7. Verify `bun dev` works

### Phase 2: Licensing & Legal
1. Add AGPL-3.0 LICENSE file
2. Update all package.json license fields
3. Add license header comment template (optional)

### Phase 3: Documentation
1. Rewrite README.md for OSS
2. Create CONTRIBUTING.md
3. Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
4. Create .env.example files
5. Remove/sanitize internal documentation

### Phase 4: Self-Hosting
1. Create apps/web/Dockerfile
2. Create root docker-compose.yml
3. Test full stack with Docker
4. Document deployment options

### Phase 5: Cleanup & Verification
1. Remove internal references
2. Search for hardcoded URLs
3. Verify .gitignore completeness
4. Test fresh clone and setup
5. Final review

## Success Criteria

1. [ ] All packages renamed to `@genfeedai/*`
2. [ ] `bun install && bun dev` works on fresh clone
3. [ ] `docker compose up` starts full stack
4. [ ] README provides clear getting started guide
5. [ ] AGPL-3.0 license properly applied
6. [ ] No internal/proprietary references remain
7. [ ] .env.example files document all required variables
8. [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md explains how to contribute

## Open Questions

1. Should we keep the `.agents/` directory or remove it entirely for OSS?
   - **Recommendation:** Keep but sanitize - it's useful for AI-assisted development
2. Should we add GitHub Actions for CI/CD?
   - **Recommendation:** Separate task, not blocking for initial release
3. Should we publish packages to npm?
   - **Recommendation:** No, keep as workspace packages for now
