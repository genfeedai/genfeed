## Summary

Add an "Auto-Layout" button to automatically reorganize all workflow nodes in a clean, hierarchical layout that minimizes edge crossings and respects execution order.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Auto-Layout button added to Toolbar
- Clicking button reorganizes all nodes without edge crossings
- Layout respects topological execution order
- All node connections preserved
- Layout completes in < 500ms for typical workflows
- Works with disconnected node groups
- Keyboard shortcut support (Cmd/Ctrl+L)
- Test coverage > 80%

## Technical Notes

- Use dagre library for graph layout (recommended)
- Integrate with existing topologicalSort from @genfeedai/core
- Update node positions via workflowStore.onNodesChange
- Consider React Flow's fitView after layout
- Optional: Animation for node movement
