## Summary
**Issue:** #214 **Priority:** P0 **Labels:** P0, Frontend **Status:** Code Complete -- QA Blocking

## Checklist
- [ ] Wire API integration for workflow CRUD -- 8 TODOs in `WorkflowEditor.tsx` (fetch, save, execute, publish, archive)
- [ ] Validate node connections: verify port types match, prevent invalid edges
- [ ] Test execution flow: trigger workflow -> nodes execute in DAG order -> results propagate
- [ ] Verify error states: node failure -> highlight failed node -> show error details
- [ ] Test undo/redo support across node add, delete, move, connect, disconnect
- [ ] Wire `ExecutionPanel.tsx:43` -- WebSocket subscription for real-time execution updates
- [ ] Fix Library, Templates, and Executions pages (all show "TODO: Fetch from API")
- [ ] Implement node registry endpoint (`GET /workflows/nodes/registry`)
- [ ] Phase 1: Backend Schema + API -- Extend workflow schema with nodes/edges/inputVariables, create node registry, add builder API endpoints and DTOs
- [ ] Phase 2: Frontend Visual Builder -- Install @xyflow/react, build WorkflowBuilder components, wire to API
- [ ] Phase 3: Execution & History -- Create WorkflowExecution collection, enhance executor, build execution history UI
- [ ] Phase 4: Scheduling -- Cron-based scheduling service, schedule endpoints, scheduling UI
