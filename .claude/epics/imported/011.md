## Summary

Add an onboarding modal with workflow templates, recent workflows, and tutorials to help users get started quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Modal appears for first-time users and new workflows
- Templates tab shows categorized workflow templates
- Clicking a template loads pre-configured nodes/edges into canvas
- Recent tab shows user's recent workflows
- Tutorials tab shows helpful learning resources
- "Start blank" option available
- "Don't show again" preference persists (localStorage)
- "Templates" button in toolbar opens modal anytime
- At least 6 starter templates included
- Mobile responsive

## Technical Notes

- Store onboarding state in zustand with localStorage persistence
- Templates defined as static JSON (nodes + edges + metadata)
- Use existing workflowStore to load template into canvas
- Generate canvas thumbnails for recent workflows (canvas snapshot or placeholder)
- Categories: getting-started, image-generation, video-generation, social-media, automation

## Initial Templates

1. Hello World (Prompt -> Flux -> Output)
2. Text to Image Pro (Prompt -> Flux -> Upscale -> Output)
3. Image to Video (Image -> Kling/Runway -> Output)
4. Instagram Post (Prompt -> Flux -> Caption -> Publish)
5. Quick Edit (Image Input -> Crop -> Output)
6. Batch Generator (Multiple prompts -> Flux -> Output)

## Dependencies

- workflowStore (load templates)
- workflowService (fetch recent workflows)
- Node type registry (validate template nodes)
